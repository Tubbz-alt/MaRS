# MaRS Laboratory SOP

* The Malaria Resistance Surveillance or MaRS pipline, consists of a standardized laboratory and bioinformatics workflow for identifying variants in *Plasmodium falciparum* genomes conferring drug resistance. By streamlinging the data QC, alignment, and variant calling process, MaRS hopes to reduce time of analysis, as well allow for flexibilty of protocol used for the BGS analysis.
* Version 3.3 (modified November 2, 2017)

### MaRS Pipeline ###

* MaRS consists of two standardized workflows:
  * Laboratory SOP
    * Latest version: Version 3.3 (modified November 2, 2017)
      * Currently validated for use with *Plasmodium falciparum* infected whole-blood samples

  * Bioinformatic pipeline
    * See MaRS README for bioinformatics pipeline protocol
